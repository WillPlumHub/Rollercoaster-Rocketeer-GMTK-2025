# gmtk-2025-project

Themed after rollercoaster loops, this puzzle game challenges players to build roller coasters capable of launching into space for next-day package delivery. Built in 96 hours as a part of the annual 2025 GTMK Game Jam. Feel free to play the web version at: https://elevatorpitchstudios.itch.io/roller-coaster-rocketeer

Core Systems:
Custom Rollercoaster Construction: Buy coaster parts that add different modifyers to your cart for the rest of the level, mainly speed. You can drag and drop these parts anywhere within the build area, as long as each peice connects end to end, the coaster will work.

Freely Explorable Space: Use your existing speed from the coaster to help propell you into the circular gravity of your delivery destination.

Key Features:
Circuit Grid Management: Strategically place weapons, health items, utilities, and passive modules on a limited circuit board.

Endless Replayability: Survive increasingly difficult enemy waves in a self-contained loop until you’re inevitably overwhelmed—or become unstoppable.

Technologies & Architecture:
Godot (GDScript) – Custom gameplay systems;

Scriptable Objects - Used extensively to define modular item behaviors and abilities for flexible content creation.
